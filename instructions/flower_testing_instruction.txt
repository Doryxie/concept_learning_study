You will see flowers displayed one at a time, and you need to determine whether each flower belongs to the species avolnia or not.
If you think the flower is avolnia, you can press the Right key to answer "Yes". If you think the flower is not avolnia, you can press the Left key to answer "No".
(When instructed, please press any key to continue.)

After the classification, you need to indicate whether you have seen the flower in previous tasks using a 4-point scale. 
The scale consists of four points: old, maybe old, maybe new, and new. "Old" means that you remember seeing the flower in previous tasks. "New" means that you don't remember seeing the flower previously.
To make your response, you need to use the mouse to click on one of the points on the scale. Please respond as fast and accurately as possible.
